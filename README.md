# Problem Statement
## Problem
Fintech company provides a subscription product to its users,
which allows them to manage their bank accounts (savings accounts, credit cards, etc),
provides them with personolized coupons, informs them of the latest low interest loans
available in the market, and educates them on the best available methods to save money
(like videos on saving money on taxes, free courses on financial health, etc).

It needs to be identified users who are likely to cancel their subscription
so that we can start building new features that they may be interested in.
These features can increase the engagement and interest of our users towards the product.
